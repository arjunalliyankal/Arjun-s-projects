"Yeah i just got covid. All i mainly got was that SEVERE headache that last all day with no breakes. 

I was at work doing fine and i just started getting really weak. Like every minute i felt weaker and weaker. I drove home, slept, and when i woke up i had the worst headache. Its weird to say but thinking made it even worse, i mean i couldnt even watch tv or read, i never felt a headache that bad before. 

Im on day 4 now, headache finally let up but those 2-3 days of just constant pain no matter what meds i too was horrid. I just developed a cough though, hoping its not a start to more symptoms"

"That's why immune system never be presented in media. Or they just can't let their people be smart. Or they just try to keep people in fearness to secretly corrupt many things. 
Be awear people. It happened in my country. Bad doctor help them corrupt either. Many doctors see it crystal clear."
"Inflammatory cytokine strome or Cytokine strome is the immune system that broken and imbalance by lack of 'molecular nutrition'. 
Zinc and vitamin D3 are in every single cells to ""stop the imflammatory cytokines"". The doctors know it and try hard to announce it just like I've been doing here. But the government? Event WHO? 
Ridiculous! Look at what they do to small people like you guys. WHO announce taking vitamin C or turmaric information recently is violatory just for reason to banned any doctor or scientist's videos those telling about lab covid19 virus.

Evidance. But not every doctors' videos are banned. Just some to make it look right and no clue.

"@nidhi Vv remember you're not yet immune to the virus, you can still be infected but with strong immune system you can recover from it faster if ever contracted. The only way to get rid of it for now is to strictly follow the quarantine plan of your country and avoid unnecessary trips outside. STAY AT HOME. Less contact with other people is key to lowering COVID-19 cases. That's it.
Less cases = less death."
"Until fucking politicians WAKE UP and use *camostat mesylate*  E MASSE...the only know drug that kills the coronas, all of them."
Thanks to huge cases it will take 2-3 years to finished and then another years to mutate and infect it again we hope the virus is likely mix with SARS and SARS-Covid-2
I feel the same way😔

I should clarify my asthma isn't of the severe kind where i had to ever nebulise myself except may be two times in my life. It's more of a rhinitis related one. Still classifies as asthma and it can be pretty frightening at times."
