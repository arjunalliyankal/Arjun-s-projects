"Thank you so much for these videos. I have a question. I got five shots of the Pfizer vaccine. I have never had any problems. I felt I couldn't breathe yesterday, so I went to the doctor. She thought that my symptoms are very close to a heart attack. So, she said, It is better to transfer me to the emergency room. I felt like I and dealing with COVID. However, I decided to go with her suggestion after a lot of samples and X-rays. The doctor told me that I have COVID. I have a few questions. Why was my case severe even though I had five shots of COVID? What would happen next? Can my body or immune system get back to normal?

I would like to see an animation about that."

"After 9 days I'm still recovering with my son. I felt like I had a stomach bug. I was driving on the interstate & had to pull over asap & got sick. Then I started to get fever,then fell asleep sitting up,coughing,sore throat,SEVERE headache,painful body aches,chills,going to the bathroom,runny/stuffy nose,sneezing,my lower legs ached. Then after about 4 days started getting winded & short of breath just walk to the bathroom & back. My brain felt foggy,Food tasted disgusting. I couldn't even keep water down. First time 2 days ago no fever..today the sharpness of the headache (migraine) isn't so painful. I ate a sandwich but tasted gross. I'm still very short of breath,weak,& sweating a lot which is weird. My son is better Thank God but weak,still coughs,& has fatigue. My grandbaby has it too:( along with his dad. Thankfully my daughter doesn't have it too. They had it 3 months ago too & it was so exhausting for her but she's an AMAZING Mommy‚ù§Ô∏è I think her bf got it from work. And I watch my grandbaby while they are at work. We had a bad storm coming so I stayed at their house with my grandbaby instead of coming back home. Then a few days later I was sick and then 2 days later my son was sick. You can get it from breathing in the same air so social distance.  After touching money,key pads,gas station doors,doors at the store to get milk..hand sanitize your hands before touching your car,keys,or phone. Masks alone can't protect you..you touch everything contaminated and the virus lives on things for a prolong period.  You can also get it in the eyes. Best thing is to social distance & hand sanitizer. And to wear a proper mask if your sick. I pray that my family gets all better and we never have to deal with this again. I pray for those that are struggling with this virus! I am 44,healthy,don't smoke,don't drink,& don't do drugs and it mopped the floor with me over & over. I had a fever break & come back 4 different times in just 1 day. It's like a drunk virus ripping havoc & chaos on your body..you don't know how you're going to feel from 1 hour to the next. (I apologize for so long..I need to get out of the house lol"

"PLEASE READ üìñ I CAN NOW BREATHE AFTER COVID LUNGS. I was hospitalised for covid on the 29.10.2021 beacuse i could not breath. I could not even brush my teeth. I was discharged on the 04.11.2021 and started to drink cocumin (jarrows formula cocumin on amazon) You take three tablets a day with your food. I cracked open the tablet and put it in my warm juiced ginger add kettle water. . Its now thd 15.11.2021 and i feel i have near enough full lung capacity. I did the down ward dog yoga pose as well as breathing excercise,  stand up breath in through your mouth, hold it for 10 seconds and repeat 3 times. You then cough three times and repeat. I found that mucus came out of my mouth. From research, cocumin is antinflamtory and ginger clears airways and anti flamatory. Please lie  on your stomache, side and other side to expand airways. Do this for hours on  end, the more the better. You can respond to this mesaage and i will get back if you want more info. I know this may not work for everyone, but its something."

"It‚Äôs been estimated that there is a 17% chance if you live in the United States to be infected with COVID-19 and about 1/4 of 1 percent chance to die from COVID-19. So the chances of someone dying from COVID is 17% of 1/4 of 1 percent chance (if you include the elderly the obese and people with immunity disorders). 
if your healthy and young and still scarred of a fraction of fraction of death then you should probably just kill yourself anyways because you shouldn‚Äôt even be able to function as a human being and leave your house.

"How is this supposed specific virus with all it's specific replicas/copies (Which, by the way, does not happen with rapidly mutating viruses like Carona viruses.) differ from other Carona viruses during the flu season? You say there are spike proteins ""left on the surface of infected cells"" causing them to fuse with other cells?
How does this happen and does this happen with other ""Carona viruses"" ? If not,.....why not. If so,...then how is this, supposed, ""SARS COV 2' virus any more virulent and lethal than other Carona viruses?
Truthfully, though, how can you can you have a pandemic of a specific virus infecting people, making identical copies of itself, which then infect other self cells (and other human's cells) making identical copies of itself..... and so on, indefinitely,
 when we know that as Carona viruses undergo replication, [because the polymerase is imperfect in laying down complementary nucleotides adjacent to the infecting primary virus template, therefore, forming non-dentical (mutated) copies], also, within approximately 4.5 months, through mutation, [(which, contrary to Darwinism evolution and consistent with entropy), always results in devolution and loss in funtion, therefore, loss in virulence],
 how can you say there is a specific virus [with a specific nucleotide and genomic sequence)
 ,(i.e) ""SARS COV 2""] spreading around the world, causing a (specific virus) pandemic? 
This, seems quite illogical and counter intuitive, to me.

"Coronavirus and influenza virus, prevention and treatment:
A whole year has passed since this research was published among the people, and not a single person who adhered to what was published was infected:
Eating a small, raw, raw, uncooked red onion (40-50 grams) to be cut directly when eating without adding vinegar or lemon to it twice a day is completely sufficient for the treatment and prevention of infection with the emerging corona virus and seasonal influenza virus, regardless of the severity of exposure to them.
To treat the injured, it is added to the above that the patient inhales an onion for ten minutes from a plastic bag in which the onions are placed immediately after chopping small pieces and forcefully exhale from the mouth outside the bag, once or twice a day, for a period of three to five consecutive days. Paracetamol is taken for high fever when necessary, with no other treatments or vitamins taken during the treatment period unless necessary. And continue eating onions after that as a precaution until the epidemic is completely over. In the case of prevention rather than treatment, the aforementioned amount of onion (medium onion of 80-100 grams) can be eaten with one meal daily.
Try it at my responsibility, and you will not lose anything, and experience is the best proof.
And for the injured, try, one day, and the temperature will decrease and breathing will improve. Be sure, only one day, and the improvement begins, then they continue, and after five days, whoever among you will make an anointing will make sure of complete healing, thanks to God.
If all of us followed that, the injuries would be completely over in one week, God willing. Thank God, not a single person who followed this has been infected since the beginning of the pandemic until March 2021.
Please, whoever this post has received to spread it to the widest extent ..
May God protect all of you and those you love."
"PROVEN CORONAVIRUS TREATMENTS THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD BE HONEST ENOUGH TO TELL CITIZENS
Please save and share to save lives before this post gets deleted.

98% of us are naturally immune to coronavirus, and will only exhibit colds or flu symptoms when infected, but for your peace of mind you can prepare for covid-19 with natural foods.  
Don't take vaccines or any pharmaceutical drugs because they will disable your immune system and make you succumb to the coronavirus. Because most of us are naturally immune to coronavirus, they will attribute this to the effectiveness of the vaccines. Any blood clot, brain damage, lifetime paralysis or death from vaccines they will attribute to virus mutation and the need for more vaccinations.

Aphrodisia--1 tsp in 1 glass water 2-3x daily, prevents the virus that has successfully entered a body shell from replicating itself,
&
Supersalts--1 drop in 1 glass water 2-6x daily for 5 days, kills the virus in the bloodstream and inside the cell,
(Both Aphro and Supersalts may be combined in 1 glass water)

Virgin coconut oil--1 tbsp 3x daily, dissolves the fatty shell of the virus,

Fish oil--2,000 mg 3x daily, dissolves the fatty shell of the virus,

Ampalaya (bitter gourd) juice--1/2-1 cup 3x daily, boosts the immune system; prevents the virus from attaching to a body cell,

Zinc supplement--20 mg 2-6x daily, prevents the virus that has already successfully entered a body cell from replicating itself,

Vitamin C--at 2,000 mg or more, 10-20x daily kills the virus and neutralizes the toxins produced by the virus,

Vitamin D--or 15 minutes sunshine, boosts the immune system, prevents cytokine storm and septic shock,

Papaya, pineapple--dissolve the protein spikes of the virus,

Melatonin--boosts the immune system, enables the repair of cells damaged by the virus,

Drink plenty of water.

Sleep 8 hours at night in a quiet, dark room.

When infected, don't eat cooked or processed foods.  Instead, eat only fruits and raw, fresh vegetables, shredded, blendered or juiced. If no money to buy the above items, take 2 tablespoons sea salt and boil in 2 cups water and breath the steam.

Pray to Yashua Mashiyach (Jesus Christ to many) for healing.

I got covid around 4 to 5 days ago and I have experienced every single symptom mentioned except diarrhea/vomiting and loss of appetite. Right now currently I'm doing better and I am mainly suffering from loss of smell and taste and it sucks. I'm starting to feel some shortness of breath and a little chest pain. I'll give it one more day and if they get worse I'll definitely go to the hospital. Please quarantine. I am 19 years old and have never been extremely sick in my life and I thought covid would not hit me as hard as it did because I usually recovered from anything in like 4 days with minimal treatment. Please stay safe guys.

"Isaiah 53:5, But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes, we are healed.¬†For salvation, people just need to follow the way they did it in Acts? They were baptized in the water and of the spirit. Here's why! The gospel is the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. If we are to follow him, we must do the same thing. Death= repentance, Burial = baptism, and resurrection = being filled with the Holy Ghost and rising again from the dead. That's what Acts 2:38 is.¬†We must obey the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 1:8-9, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that OBEY NOT THE GOSPEL of our Lord Jesus Christ... Matthew 7:21-23, Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that DOETH THE WILL OF MY FATHER which is in Heaven. St John 3:3-5, EXCEPT a man, be born of WATER AND OF THE SPIRIT, he cannot enter into the kingdom of GOD.¬†We can't come up with our own gospel. Galatians 1:8-9, But though we or an angel from heaven¬†preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. Don't be cursed. One way for all people. Jews, Gentiles, and Samaritans. Our salvation has to match-up with the scriptures and no scriptures on the subject can be taken away.¬†Eternity is TOOO long to be WRONG! st, John 5:39, Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life: and they are they which testify of me.¬†The gospels show what Christ has done on the cross for us. The book of Acts shows us the beginning of Christ's Church and how to enter the Church, obeying Acts 2:38. The letters were written to the Church to show us how to behave now that we are born again into the Church.¬†It's better to walk alone than to walk with a crowd going in the wrong direction. Are we supposed to follow the teachings of the apostles? Acts 2:42, They continued steadfastly in the apostle's doctrines. Ephesians 2:20, We are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone. Jesus Christ was our perfect example back to God. He was baptized and received the Holy Ghost and we must be baptized and receive the Holy Ghost. He was holy and walked in righteousness and we must be holy and walk in righteousness. He died and rose again, and we must die to the things of this world and rise to walk in the newness of life. He prayed to the father showing us how to pray to the father. If you believe in this message, help spread it in the name of Jesus Christ. God bless you for doing so."

"Viruses are dead, they cannot replicate, so they can't possibly be contagious!! This is why antibiotics do not work on viruses, THEY'RE NOT ALIVE, THEY CANNOT REPRODUCE!! Your body CREATES viruses to help in the elimination of toxins that you ingest in food, air, and water!!"
"I had symptoms such as lower back pain, painful kidneys, sort of raised temperature, shortness of breath, was it covid19?"
I have it like rn
"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. Most people who fall sick with COVID-19 will experience mild to moderate symptoms and recover without special treatment.
HOW IT SPREADS
The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.

You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth. 

Coronaviruses are a large family of zoonotic viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to severe respiratory diseases. Zoonotic means these viruses are able to be transmitted from animals to humans. There are several coronaviruses known to be circulating in different animal populations that have not yet infected humans. 

Animals are the most likely source of the COVID-19. It is possible that the COVID-19 virus originated from animals before it infected humans. However, the specific source of COVID-19 virus is yet to be confirmed.

COVID-19 is the most recent to make the jump to human infection. If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, stay safe by taking some simple precautions, such as physical distancing, wearing a mask, keeping rooms well ventilated, avoiding crowds, cleaning your hands, and coughing into a bent elbow or tissue. Check local advice from where you live and work. 

Maintain at least a 1-metre distance between yourself and others to reduce your risk of infection when they cough, sneeze or speak. 
Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there, the virus can enter your body and infect you. 
Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and phone screens. And also for those who are a fan of shopping online, once you receive your package that is being delivered don‚Äôt forget to disinfect your package well. 
Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands. 

proper nutrition and hydration improve health and immunity, People living with chronic illnesses who have suspected or confirmed COVID-19 may need support with their mental health and diet to ensure they keep in good health. Seek counseling and psychosocial support from appropriately trained health care professionals and also community-based lay and peer counsellors. 

Don‚Äôt forget to Drink enough water every day, Make sure to take your vitamins, Eat fresh and unprocessed foods every day. Do not overcook vegetables and fruits  as this can lead to the loss of important vitamins. When using canned or dried vegetables and fruits , choose varieties without added salt or sugar. Avoid eating out and instead just eat at home to reduce your rate of contact with other people and lower your chance of being exposed to COVID-19. 
And those are just some of the information about the Covid-19."

"By the way, a friend of mine died several years ago for having Type 2 diabetes. 

The result of having lack of exercise and lack of physical education.

Died at age 31."
"The part suggesting that all chronically ill people over 30 are the bait says it all.

So yeah! Chronic diseases and the Kung flu are two sides of the same coin. 

For instance, if you got the irreversible Type 2 diabetes, then you are fucked. 

Either diabetes and lack of exercise kill you or coronashit preys on you for having too much blood sugar."

So she just came back, and we had a BBQ.

I was going to warn my family, but I didn‚Äôt want them to get angry, and say ‚Äúthis ain‚Äôt something we should be talking about rn‚Äù. I‚Äôm scared, not for me only, but those who were in the celebration of her coming back home.

Edit: although  my grandma never shown any symptoms of Covid-19, and I never hear her cough.

"This is how every viruses infect animals/human's cell, not only Corona IBV. The further important isn't in this video is ""Immune system"".

Not everyone who got infected by Cov-19 get severe illness because their immune system is actually great and strong.

When the cell is infected by only single  1 virus cell, the cell gonna release many cytokines to call NKcell, Tcell to kill the virus.
Risk group of patients have low Tcell, NKcell naturally such as elder persons, cancer, diabetes and obesity.
Kidney disease patients aren't even risk, but many of them dead recently without Cov-19 infection. Why? Cause of the stress! Stress leads the inflammatory cytokines. 
>>People who died after Cov-19 infection, died from 'Inflammatory cytokine strome'. Not from Cov-19.<<

This is fact, real, important imformation  that people never know because the press never report it. But there're many in medical document data. The press and government don't understand it, so they think people won't be stupid like them."

"Very well explained,üëçüèæüëçüèæ
In reality covid is not as dangerous as our media shows us, due to which if a person found to be covid +ve he/she starts to panic and ends up full of  stress and anxiety.
So the best way is to maintain social distancing and not treating covid as the deadliest disease. 
Stay safe....."

Would you like to this video to have Arabic language subtitles?"
Wonder what took you so long to have this video
Are the viral S proteins left on the surface of the cell or are they transcribed from the RNA and sent to the surface?
"this is the 2nd video from this CORRUPTED company which misinforms the public regarding the replication process of mentioned virus.

nonsense !

the ribosome does not copy RNA; which is another essentially crucial step for a successful replication cycle of the virus!

to HELL with all the liers!

Protein S is energy of human found in the blood. Vegetables and fruits are proteins S more intake more energy
